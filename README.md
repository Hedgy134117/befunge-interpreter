# befunge-interpreter
A befunge interpreter written in python

## Usage
Run with `python main.py <filepath>`

## Features
Definitions of instructions found [here](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge)
- [x] `+`	Addition: Pop two values a and b, then push the result of a+b
- [x] `-`	Subtraction: Pop two values a and b, then push the result of b-a
- [x] `*`	Multiplication: Pop two values a and b, then push the result of a*b
- [x] `/`	Integer division: Pop two values a and b, then push the result of b/a, rounded down. According to the specifications, if a is zero, ask the user what result they want.
- [ ] `%`	Modulo: Pop two values a and b, then push the remainder of the integer division of b/a.
- [ ] `!`	Logical NOT: Pop a value. If the value is zero, push 1; otherwise, push zero.
- [ ] `\``	Greater than: Pop two values a and b, then push 1 if b>a, otherwise zero.
- [x] `>`	PC direction right
- [x] `<`	PC direction left
- [x] `^`	PC direction up
- [x] `v`	PC direction down
- [x] `?`	Random PC direction
- [x] `_`	Horizontal IF: pop a value; set direction to right if value=0, set to left otherwise
- [x] `|`	Vertical IF: pop a value; set direction to down if value=0, set to up otherwise
- [x] `"`	Toggle stringmode (push each character's ASCII value all the way up to the next ")
- [x] `:`	Duplicate top stack value
- [ ] `\`	Swap top stack values
- [x] `$`	Pop (remove) top stack value and discard
- [x] `.`	Pop top of stack and output as integer
- [x] `,`	Pop top of stack and output as ASCII character
- [x] `#`	Bridge: jump over next command in the current direction of the current PC
- [ ] `g`	A "get" call (a way to retrieve data in storage). Pop two values y and x, then push the ASCII value of the character at that position in the program. If (x,y) is out of bounds, push 0
- [ ] `p`	A "put" call (a way to store a value for later use). Pop three values y, x and v, then change the character at the position (x,y) in the program to the character with ASCII value v
- [ ] `&`	Get integer from user and push it
- [ ] `~`	Get character from user and push it
- [x] `@`	End program
- [x] `0 â€“ 9`	Push corresponding number onto the stack
